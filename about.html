                    <p>Established in 2001, the Edinburgh University Kendo Club (EUKC) has grown from a small practice group to a recognised competitive club within the British Kendo Association (BKA). Our members regularly participate in inter-university tournaments including the Scottish Universities Taikai and the UK Universities Kendo Championship.</p>
                    <p>We maintain affiliation with the BKA and follow the grading system established by the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF), ensuring our practice adheres to international standards.</p>

                        <p>"To mold the mind and body, to cultivate a vigorous spirit, and through correct and rigid training, to strive for improvement in the art of Kendo."</p>
